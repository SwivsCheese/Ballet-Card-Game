      <h2>Welcome to Ballet!</h2>

      <p>This is a turn-based card game where you can play against your friends</p>
      <p>To play, make a custom code to put within the "insert room name" text and have someone else type the same thing.</p>
      <p>Once you are in the game with the other person, and it is your turn, draw cards from the deck on your right.</p>
      <p>To place cards from your hand onto the board, drag the card to the highlighted squares shown when holding a card. Movement afterwards works the exact same.</p>
      <p>To attack, you have to be within a 1 square distance of the other card & the other card has to be an enemy. click on your card and then hover over the enemy card, and click the attack button.</p>
      <p>To use abilities, your card has to have an ability. ranges will vary, but some cards attach to other cards and go as far as possible, while other abilites may be played from the hand.</p>
      <p>To use attach abilities, attach an attach card to an attacker card. Afterwards, that attacker card can use that attach ability, just like a normal ability.</p>
      <p>You are allowed to do this amount of actions per turn:</p>
      <p>deploy 2 cards to the board</p>
      <p>move 2 cards already on the board</p>
      <p>use an 1 ability per card</p>
      <p>attack 3 times, although it has to be with separate cards</p>
      <p>in order to win, destroy the other player's dirtblock</p>
